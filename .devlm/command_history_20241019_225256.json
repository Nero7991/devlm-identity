      "analysis": "The main.go file appears to be well-structured and implements a robust API server with authentication, authorization, and various endpoints for user management and SSH key operations. The code includes proper error handling, middleware usage, and graceful shutdown. However, there are a few potential improvements:\n\n1. Consider moving the route definitions to a separate function for better organization.\n2. Implement HTTPS support for enhanced security.\n3. Add configuration options for server address and timeouts.\n4. Consider implementing request validation middleware.\n\nThe file is ready for testing, but these improvements could enhance maintainability and security. Next step: Implement HTTPS support and add configuration options for server settings."
