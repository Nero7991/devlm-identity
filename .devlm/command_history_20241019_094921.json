The implementation includes input validation, password hashing, and database interaction. The test covers the creation of a new user and handling of duplicate users.\n\nTo improve test coverage, we should add tests for:\n1. Input validation (invalid email, username, or password)\n2. Error handling for database failures\n3. Role assignment during user creation\n4. Password complexity requirements\n\nNext step: Implement these additional test cases in `user_test.go` to ensure comprehensive coverage of the user registration process."
