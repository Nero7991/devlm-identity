      "analysis": "The main.go file appears well-structured and comprehensive. It sets up the server, database connection, and routes for the identity management system. The file includes proper error handling, middleware setup, and graceful shutdown. No immediate improvements are needed. However, to ensure everything is working correctly, we should focus on testing the various endpoints and services. The next step should be to inspect the test files, particularly cmd/api/main_test.go, to see if there are existing tests or if we need to create new ones to cover all the functionality implemented in main.go."
